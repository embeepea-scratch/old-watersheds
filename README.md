Watersheds
==========

This is an interactive map that shows the topological relationships between
the USGS level 12 hydrologic units for the United States (see
https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html).

You can see this application online at http://demos.fernleafinteractive.com/watersheds.

It follows the cursor as you move it, always coloring the region upstream
of the cursor position red, and the downstream region blue.

Zoom in on some place on the Mississippi River (or any other river),
and hover the mouse exactly over the river to see an example.

The code here is still quite messy; I will be cleaning this up over the
next few weeks before showing it to anyone.
